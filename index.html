            <p id="story-1">Hi! I'm BLUEtiful the clown. My father always told me I could be anything I wanted to be. My father believed in me and he had big dreams for me. I however had other dreams. When I was about 3 years old, my father was out in the yard building a picket fence and I said, "When I grow up I'm going to be a clown. I can even perform magic. Look, I can walk on nails."
    The next thing I remember was waking up with bandages on my foot. That was the start of Bluetiful the clown...
            </p>

                I didn't think about being a clown again until my son Miguel was in kindergarten and about to turn 6 years old. I wanted to hire a clown for his party but I soon found out that a clown was not in my budget. I thought to myself, "I could be the clown". With the help of my sweet friend Janet, we were the hit of the party. We had a lot of FUN! Thank you Janet.
            </p>
            <p id="story-3">
                Since that day, I became passionate about being the best clown I could be. I was determined and practiced day and night. I'm always growing as a clown and have done many parties since then.  You can inquire about <a href="#" id="book">booking me</a> for your event or check out my <a href="#">gallery</a> and/or <a href="#">facebook</a> to see more of my work and what I'm currently up to. To my dad (in memory) and to my three children. I hope I make you proud!
