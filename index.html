        <p id="story-1">Hi!  I'm BLUEtiful the clown. My father always told me I could be anything I wanted to be. My father believed in me and he had certain big dreams for me. I however had other dreams.
        </p>
        <p id="story-2">
            When I was about 3 years old, my father was out in the yard building a picket fence and I said, "When I grow up I'm going to be a clown. I can even perform magic. Look, I can walk on nails."
The next thing I remember was waking up with bandages on my foot. That was the start of the Bluetiful Life...
